Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. “Ice,” that sword was called. It was as wide across as a
man’s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as
smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.
	His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his 
household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, “In the name of Robert of the House
Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of
the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark,
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, I do sentence you to die.” He lifted the greatsword
high above his head.
